# Junet â€” Networks Package for Julia

Junet is a new package for network analysis that seeks
to be a fast and hackable alternative to mainstream
libraries like *NetworkX*, *igraph*, and *graph-tool*.
Unlike other Julia packages, it allows to quickly traverse and modify
the graphs as well as to associate the attributes with their nodes and edges.

!!! info
    Currently, Junet is in *alpha* stage: many features are being ported from
    experimental branches. Some things may break unexpectedly.
    To report a problem, please create an issue here. To contribute some code, please fork this repository and create a pull request.
